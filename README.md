Elmer is a utility inspired by my collection of python helper scripts that I use both in developing distributed applications based on RabbitMQ, and in debugging issues at customer sites. In particular, I wanted to start collecting the functionality of these scripts into something that would be portable (a single-file binary that runs on Windows/Mac/Linux) and had a suitable GUI that would make it immediately accessible for colleagues.
